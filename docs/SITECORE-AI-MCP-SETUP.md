# Sitecore AI Marketer MCP Setup

This document describes how to set up and use the **Sitecore AI Marketer MCP** (Model Context Protocol) with Cursor IDE to interact with the Brother site in XM Cloud.

## What is Marketer MCP?

The Marketer MCP is Sitecore's official Model Context Protocol server for marketing. It connects AI agents to Sitecore tools through the Agent APIs, providing secure access across the entire digital experience platform.

    }
  }

```

Save the file.

## Troubleshooting

### "Resource parameter is required" Error

If you encounter this error during OAuth authentication:

1. Copy the entire URL shown in the dialog
2. Append the following resource parameter to the end:
   ```
   &resource=https%3A%2F%2Fedge-platform.sitecorecloud.io%2Fmcp%2Fmarketer-mcp-prod
   ```
3. Open the updated URL in a new browser window to continue authentication

### Connection Issues

- Ensure you have an active Sitecore Cloud Portal session
- Verify your account has permissions for the Brother site tenant
- Check your network allows connections to `edge-platform.sitecorecloud.io`

### Token Expiration

The MCP uses OAuth tokens that may expire. If you see authentication errors:
1. Disconnect the MCP server in Cursor settings
2. Reconnect and re-authorize

## Security

The Marketer MCP uses:
- **OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow** with interactive user authentication via Sitecore Identity
- **Tenant-level isolation** ensuring actions only affect your selected tenant
- **Secure token management** with automatic refresh
