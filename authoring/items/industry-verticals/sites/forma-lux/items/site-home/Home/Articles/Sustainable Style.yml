        <div class="ck-content"><p>More consumers are choosing furniture that not only looks good, but does good. Look for pieces made from responsibly-sourced wood, low-VOC finishes, recycled metal, and textiles certified for sustainability. Modern design is an ideal match: its emphasis on material honesty and simplicity fits sustainably‐made furniture beautifully. Choose solid construction — high-quality joinery, durable materials — so your investment lasts. When you buy less, buy well, you reduce waste. The result: a home that reflects your values and your style, both at once.</p></div>
