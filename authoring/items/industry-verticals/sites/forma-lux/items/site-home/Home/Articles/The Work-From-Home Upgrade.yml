        <div class="ck-content"><p>Working at home doesn’t mean working from a couch anymore. Define your zone with a quality desk that offers both workspace and style—a wood top with slender metal legs, or a compact modular unit. Choose an ergonomic chair with clean lines so it looks as good as it works. Keep storage streamlined: floating shelves, closed-cabinets to hide clutter, and minimal desk accessories. Lighting matters: natural if possible, supplemented by a modern floor or task lamp. Add a few personal touches—artwork, a plant, a textured rug—but keep the feel calm and uncluttered. The result: a home office that looks modern and keeps you focused.</p></div>
