# Project Context

## Repository Overview

This is the **SitecoreAI Front End Application Industry Verticals Sites** repository containing multiple Next.js starter applications and SPA examples for Sitecore XM Cloud development.

Repository Structure:
- `/industry-verticals/` - Contains front-end applications (Next.js and SPA)
- `/authoring/` - Sitecore content items, templates, and deployment configurations  
- `/local-containers/` - Docker setup for local development environments
- `xmcloud.build.json` - Primary configuration for XM Cloud deployment

## Industry Verticals Frontend Applications

Available Sites:
- `healthcare` - **Nova Medical** - Healthcare focused site template with physicians listing
- `luxury-retail` - **Essential Living** - Retail focused site template for an upscale furniture brand with products and articles
- `retail` - **FormaLux** - Retail focused site template for a furniture brand with products and articles
- `starter` - **starter** - Simple Next.js starter with basic components
- `travel` - **Skywings** - Travel focused site template with articles and destinations

Each site demonstrates:
- Tailwind-based styling with Shadcn/ui components
- Personalized homepage via URL parameters
- Modular component architecture with variants
- Localization support for English (en), French (fr-FR), Spanish (es-ES)

## Technology Stack

Core Technologies:
- **Next.js 15+** - React framework with App Router and Pages Router support
- **TypeScript** - Strict type safety throughout all components
- **Sitecore XM Cloud** - Headless content management and delivery
- **Sitecore Content SDK** - Modern SDK for XM Cloud integration
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS with container queries (@container)
- **Shadcn/ui** - Modern component library with accessibility features

Additional Libraries:


Development Tools:
- **Docker** - Containerized local development with Sitecore CM
- **Node.js LTS** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **npm** - Package management across all site applications

## Development Principles

Multi-Site Architecture:
- Each example is a standalone application
- Shared patterns and conventions across all Sites
- Independent deployment and development workflows
- Common SitecoreAI integration patterns

Content-First Development:
- Components are designed around Sitecore data structures
- Field-driven rendering with proper fallbacks
- Support for both connected and disconnected development modes
- Proper handling of content authoring scenarios

## Constraints and Guidelines

File Organization:
- Each site maintains its own `src/` directory structure
- Shared utilities should be copied, not shared (no monorepo linking)
- Configuration files specific to each site
- Independent package.json for each site

Development Workflow:

DMZ git flow will be implemented in the future to support better development practices, scaling, efficiency and developer productivity.
Below is an outline of the planned workflow and processes that will be followed:

- Has a shared main repo (`upstream repository`) with two key branches: `main` and `dmz`
- Each contributor uses their own fork as their workspace
- Feature branches are sourced from `main` but Pull Requests (PRs) with changes are merged to `dmz` branch 
- `main` branch in the `upstream repository` is always clean (deployable, branchable and reliable). It does not accept PRs created by developers.
- Developers should push changes to feature branches in their own fork and then create PRs to `dmz` branch in the `upstream repository`.  
- PRs are merged by reviewers to the `dmz` branch after review and validation. Conflicts should be resolved by rebasing onto main. 
- Once a PR has been merged into `dmz` branch the code changes are validated through an automated full build of the `dmz` branch `HEAD` in the Continous Integration server.  
- The `dmz` branch acts as a staging/integration branch and once sevearl chnages are integrated and tested in the `dmz` branch they can be manually merged to the `main` branch using merge commits (usually at the end of 1 or 2 weeks)
- If the build fails, the changes are or issues are found in the `dmz` branch during integration, the problamatic commits can be reverted

- Each site can be developed independently in its own directory
- Copy `.env.remote.site` to `.env.local` for local development
- Required environment variables: `SITECORE_EDGE_CONTEXT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SITE_NAME`, `SITECORE_EDITING_SECRET`
- Docker containers available for full local Sitecore development stack

Local Development Setup:
```bash
# Navigate to any site
cd industry-verticals/retail

# Copy environment template
cp .env.remote.site .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your SitecoreAI values
# Install dependencies and start
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deployment:
- Uses `xmcloud.build.json` for rendering host configuration
- Each site can be enabled/disabled for deployment via `enabled` flag
- Supports multiple rendering hosts in single repository
- Automatic editing host creation when split deployment is disabled
- Environment-specific configuration through SitecoreAI Deploy Portal
