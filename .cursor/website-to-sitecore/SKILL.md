# Website to Sitecore

Use this skill when the user wants to mimic a website/page and produce Sitecore Content SDK components plus serialization YAML.

## Outcome

Produce:

```txt
design-screenshots/{project}/...
src/components/{namespace}/{Component}.tsx
.sitecore/component-map*.ts
authoring/items/{module}/...
```

## Workflow

1. **Capture** — run `capture-website` for URL inputs. Skip capture when screenshots already exist.
2. **Analyze visually** — run `visual-cms-map` on full-page screenshots + section crops.
3. **Create review manifest** — list components with action: `create`, `reuse`, `skip`, or `unclear`.
4. **Stop for user approval** before writing TSX/YAML, unless the user explicitly asked for a no-review batch.
5. **Build approved items** — run `sitecore-from-capture`.
6. **Generate serialization** — run `sitecore-yaml`.
7. **Validate** — run `npm run build`, then `dotnet sitecore serialization validate --fix`.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Do not build components from URL memory. Use screenshots/HTML/manifests as evidence.
- Do not create one component per `div`; create CMS-authorable renderings.
- Do not duplicate components already marked `reuse` in `new-sections-manifest.json`.
- Do not copy GUIDs from another project.
- Do not hardcode marketing content in TSX; make content editable fields.
- Keep all generated files inside the current rendering host and current serialization module.

## Review manifest shape

```json
{
  "project": "example-com",
  "pages": ["home"],
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "S1",
      "cmsName": "HeroBanner",
      "scope": "page",
      "action": "create",
      "evidence": ["design-screenshots/example-com/sections/hero-banner/hero-banner-desktop.png"],
      "fields": ["title", "body", "primaryLink", "image"],
      "placeholders": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Write this manifest to:

```txt
design-screenshots/{project}/component-review.json
```
